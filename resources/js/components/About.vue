<p>Hello,</p>
<p>
Thanks for visiting my site! Kikiio is meant to be a space for my personal experimental projects. I hope some of them will turn into something big, something that contributes to better our society as a whole (hints: technology with heart). But otherwise, they are a means for me to learn and try new technologies.Your feedbacks are always welcomed, and so are your financial support! You are of course also very welcomed to try and make use of them.

<p class="h5">About the name:</p>
<p> 
"Kiki" (機器) means machine in Japanese. This machine has a heart. I want my creations to be humanist, to put people first rather than profits.
