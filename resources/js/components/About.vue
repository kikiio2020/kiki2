<p>Hello,</p>
<p>
Thanks for visiting my site! Kikiio is a space for my personal projects. I want to build “good” software, as in good for everybody. (hints: technology with heart). Technology should benefit all, not just the few. Here I want to build up ideas and products that are sustained not by profit-driven motives, but by benefiting society as a whole. Your feedbacks are always welcomed, and so are your <a href="https://www.patreon.com/kikiio2020" target="_blank">financial support</a>! You are of course also very welcomed to try and make use of my creations!
</p>
<p class="h5">About the name:</p>
<p> 
"Kiki" (機器) means machine in Japanese. This machine has a heart. I want my creations to be humanist, to put people first rather than profits.
